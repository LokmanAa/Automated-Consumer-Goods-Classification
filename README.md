Automated Consumer Goods Classification

This project focuses on the classification of consumer goods through machine learning, specifically working with unstructured data types such as text and images. Unlike previous projects involving structured data, this challenge delves into the preprocessing and modeling techniques needed to handle and analyze complex, unstructured data. I've learned the key methods used for text and image processing, develop expertise in feature engineering for these data types, and build both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to classify consumer goods effectively.
 
Key Skills Acquired:

    Text Data Preprocessing: Handling and transforming textual data for analysis, including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
    Image Data Preprocessing: Working with image data through techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare images for deep learning models.
    Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from raw text and image data to improve model performance.
    Machine Learning Modeling: Building and training supervised and unsupervised models for classification tasks using specialized algorithms for text (NLP) and image data (Computer Vision).
    Deep Learning: Developing and implementing deep learning models for more accurate and scalable classification, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images.
    Dimensionality Reduction: Using techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data (e.g., large text or image datasets).
    API Integration: Learning to collect and use data via APIs, expanding the scope of data collection and enhancing model development.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.

Technologies Used:

    Python: Programming language for data manipulation, feature engineering, and model development.
    Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.
    TensorFlow / Keras: Deep learning frameworks used for implementing neural networks, particularly for image classification.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques for working with text data, including libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and transformers for text classification tasks.
    OpenCV / PIL: Libraries for image processing and manipulation.
    APIs: Using APIs to collect text and image data for model training.
